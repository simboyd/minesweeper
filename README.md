# minesweeper
A very simplistic but playable minesweeper thrown together in SDL2 very quickly. I didn't bother implementing question mark tiles (because who the hell uses that feature anyway), as well as customizing board size and bomb amount.

<small>I wrote most of this in my free time at a night-shift call center job that I had for a while. A nice coworker helped me to re-discover this game and re-taught me the rules and tricks. I'd have asked her out, but pretty sure she had a boyfriend who didn't write code.</small>
